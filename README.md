# Space Battle Game

Space Battle Game is a fun 2-player Pygame project where players control spaceships and battle each other in a shrinking battlefield!

## Features
- **Battle Royale Mode**: The play area shrinks over time, forcing players closer together.
- **Health Bars**: Visual health indicators above the spaceships.
- **Power-Ups** (Optional): Add dynamic bonuses during the game.
- **Custom Spaceships**: Unique movements and controls for each player.

## How to Play
1. Player 1 (Yellow spaceship) controls:
   - Move: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
   - Shoot: `Left Ctrl`
2. Player 2 (Red spaceship) controls:
   - Move: Arrow keys
   - Shoot: `Right Ctrl`

Survive and eliminate the opponent by reducing their health to zero!
